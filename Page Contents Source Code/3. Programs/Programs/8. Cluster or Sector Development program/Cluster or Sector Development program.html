<h2>Cluster/Sector Development program</h2>
<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
	<p>Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) are recognized as a driver of economic development of Sri Lanka. However, it has been observed that the majority of the Sri Lankan MSMEs are isolated and are left to continue their production processes without proper guidance. Apparent fact is such entrepreneurs are unable to face the continuous challenges individually.</p>

	<p>As a remedy to these challenges, the cluster/sector based promotional and development approaches are proposed while managing the limited funds of NEDA. It is expected that cluster/ sector-based approach carries many advantages such as cost reduction, resource efficiency, easy management, training and technological innovation, easier access to finance and greater institutional support. It also becomes more cost- effective for the government and other supporting agencies to provide Business Development Services(BDS) to a whole cluster of enterprises rather than to individual enterprises in several locations.</p>
