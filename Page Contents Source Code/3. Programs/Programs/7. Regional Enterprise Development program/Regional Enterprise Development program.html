<h2>Regional Enterprise Development program</h2>
<br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The growth and expansion of MSMEs are constrained by issues emanating from product and factor markets and the regulatory system they operate in. These problems fall into broad areas of access to finance, physical infrastructure, level of technology, regulatory framework, access to information and advice, access to markets, business development services, industrial relations and labour legislation, intellectual property rights, technical and managerial skills, linkage formation and environmental issues.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">NEDA has identified the above concerns faced by the entrepreneurs and implemented short term capacity development trainings, financial assistance, market facilitation, and other enterprise development activities and follow up services for those entrepreneurs in regional level in all districts. NEDA obtains project proposal from Development officers through respective Divisional/District Secretariats and provide financial support to implement such proposals.</p>
