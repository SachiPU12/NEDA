<h2>MSME Data Base</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><p>In Sri Lanka, there is no proper single database developed by any institution to capture all MSME data. Lack of such dedicated MSME database is a serious issue in developing of strategic/policy decisions in the industry sector. Having identified this lacuna, NEDA established an MSME Data Base aiming to enter the information of all entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka. This will allow the development officers of NEDA to have the data of Entrepreneurs in soft format and update them periodically. Additionally, we believe this endeavour will stimulate research and development in the industry sector as well.</p></div>
<br>

<div style="color: purple;">
	<h4><b>The main highlighted Objectives of establishing MSME database</b></h4>
	<ul style="line-height:180%">
		<li>Information dissemination through printed and electronic material</li>
		<li>Digitalizing NEDA activities</li>
		<li>Ensuring Effective response to the needs of the Enterprises</li>
		<li>Providing market linkages facilities for the SMEs</li>
	</ul>

	<h4><b>Scope</b></h4>
	<p>This system will consist of mainly two subsystems: a web application and a mobile application. NEDA officers, regional officers of each district secretariat division, resource persons (authorized individuals for catering intellectual resources to the entrepreneurs), entrepreneurs, and the general public will be the stakeholders of the system. The mobile application will enable regional officers to gather information about entrepreneurs via a forum and submit as requests for the reference of NEDA officers. Once these requests are confirmed and approved by the NEDA, the database will be updated. The web application will have a portal to view and download data from the backend database. Also, it will have a login option for NEDA officers to access the system and add/update/delete records.</p>

	<h4><b>Functions</b></h4>
	<ol style="line-height:180%">
		<li>Mobile Application<br>The mobile application is for the use of regional officers in each district secretariat division. The application will support an online forum feature to collect details about entrepreneurs and the forum should be sent as a request for the reference of NEDA officers and If any information of an entrepreneur needs to be updated, regional officers can send them as requests. If an existing entrepreneur is shutting down his/her business, regional officers can inform those via the application.</li>
		<li>Web Application<br>Web Application Authorized NEDA officers can visit the website, filter, and view details about entrepreneurs, download data in SPSS compatible format. Each authorized NEDA officer will have a unique username and password to login to the system and, add/update/delete records according to the requests from regional officers.</li>
