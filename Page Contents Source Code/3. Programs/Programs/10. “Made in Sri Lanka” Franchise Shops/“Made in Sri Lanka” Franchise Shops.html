<h2>“Made in Sri Lanka” Franchise Shops</h2>
<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
	<p>Marketing is one of the main issues that SMEs are facing recently and to provide a platform to such SMEs, “Made in Sri Lanka” franchise shops will be established in places of leading customer attractions (Local & International). Those Trade stalls are operated by the Private Sector and this mechanism will assist SMEs to improve marketing linkages throughout the country. Suppliers with “Made in Sri Lanka logo” will have the opportunity to showcase their products in franchise shops offering an opportunity to improve their revenue.</p>

	<p>With the country’s growing eminence, NEDA will choose most promising locations to establish Made in Sri Lanka franchise Shops island-wide to promote our heritage under one umbrella. The shops will be selected by NEDA by inviting such interested local entrepreneurs/tenants to come up with their own business places. The design of each shop must integrate with branding, colours, materials, lighting, display and visual merchandising to maximize its appeal to complement the whole shopping experience.</p>
	
	<p>A franchise business is a process in which the NEDA as the ‘franchiser’, sells the rights, business logo, name and model to third party retail outlets owned by independent businessmen (SMEs) known as a ‘franchisee’. The NEDA will manage all franchising matters of tenants and upon confirmation of agreement to franchise, NEDA will commence the design and fit out process with the tenants.</p>

	<p>Tenants will also need to engage a reputed contractor to put up the shop under the auspices of NEDA. Once the place is selected, a formal contract will be signed along with necessary permits, insurance and other documentation.</p>

	<p>An experience Development Officer will be appointed to handle all related work on behalf of NEDA. NEDA will also organize regular committee meetings to monitor the success of the venture.</p>
