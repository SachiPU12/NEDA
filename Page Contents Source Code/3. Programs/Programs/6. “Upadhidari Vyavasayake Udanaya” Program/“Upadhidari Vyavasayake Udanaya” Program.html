<p style="text-align: justify;">MSMEs play a key role in terms of employment generation and smoothing out of regional disparities. With the growing recognition of the need for a domestic production economy, there is a need to recognize the dearth of support for MSMEs, which are the backbone of a sustainable production economy (Source: Central Bank Report 2020). Specially, statistics from the ILO shows a continued rise in the proportion of unemployed youth engaging in an enterprise is one of the best solutions to the problem of youth unemployment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Having understood this fact, NEDA launched a specialized program for motivating university graduates, in order to develop them as successful entrepreneurs by improving their skills and directing to capitalize the opportunities in the business world. It requires tangible effort to embed entrepreneurship education and the development of soft skills in order to create a conductive environment for this initiative. NEDA is of the view that the existing carrier guidance units of universities will play a crucial role in making entrepreneurial graduates and create career opportunities to others through suchgraduate entrepreneurs.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually graduates opt to pursue employment due to social pressure and lack of awareness about the benefits that may accruein being an entrepreneur. Moreover, lack of awareness of enterprise opportunities, lack of knowledge in business undertaking, shortage of seed capital and the risks involved in business undertakings have demotivated graduates in engaging in business ventures. Having identified the above these concerns, NEDA has designed and introduced this Graduate Entrepreneurs program.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">NEDA plans to implement this “Upadhidari Vyavasayake Udanaya” Program with all interested universities while obtaining the assistance of the carrier guidance unit of the such universities for the selection and monitoring of beneficiaries.</p>
