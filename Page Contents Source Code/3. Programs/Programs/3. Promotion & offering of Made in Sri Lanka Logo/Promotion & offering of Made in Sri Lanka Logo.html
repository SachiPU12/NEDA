<p style="text-align: justify;">Though there are plenty of local businesses being carried out with local resources, there was no proper recognition for the local products when compared to the imported products. Consequently, the customers used to give priority for the products which were imported. As a result, the demand for the local products become diminished while customers used to think that the imported products are of superior quality than the local products. To address this issue, NEDA has taken a step to promote the locally made products by introducing a Logo (Made in Sri Lanka), launched in December 2022, to depict the degree of “localness” of the products.</p>
